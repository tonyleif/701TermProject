# TermProject

I will submit without node modules so you will need to run and npm install.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Actually, I prefer 'ng serve --open' as that will navigate to the page for you.

See the About page that explains the site and how to use it. This is the most informative page.

The version control is hosted on GitHub here: https://github.com/tonyleif/701TermProject
